a.
This app is about various types of motorbikes. It allows user to use specific
login credentials (username: 40181252, password: pw) to browse between
different pages, and upload an image. Users are unable to view the content
without using these login details.

b.
First page allows user to either login or register on the web-app. If user
decides to go on the login page then the user needs to use specific login
details (mentioned in section A). Upon a successful login a flash message shows
up that tells user the login was successful. On the top of page a menu will
appear which gives the option to navigate between the pages. The motors
dropdown menu displays three different types of motors (motocross, sport bike
and cruiser)
These pages have a relevant title, image and description of the vehicle. There
is also a quote from a famous person who has experience with the particular
motorbike.
Upload page allows user to upload an image which will be stored in a folder of
the application. The logout page ends the session and the user will be
navigated back to the login page.
Upon a successful logout a flash message will show up that tells user the
logout was successful.
If the user accidently enters an invalid URL address a 404 error page will
appear (it allows user to go back to the home page)

Twitter Bootstrap was used and it was modified appropriately.
Design and URL structure are consistent and relevant.

c.
Features I would add:
  - Option 1. Validation that validates the input boxes
    (login, upload and registration)
  - Option 2. Registration, users could register themselves
  - Option 3. Admin section that removes/adds content, updates user details and
    removes users if necessary

d. 
Options from section C should have been implemented during the development of
the application.

e.
Time was a real challenge. I spent more time on this coursework than on the
previous one. Still it was insufficient.
I also tried to use other resources from websites, but I did not find anything
that I could use.

f. 
Resources:
Apart from the upload section I used existing knowledge and workbook notes from
module.
Upload section:
